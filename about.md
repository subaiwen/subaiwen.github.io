<hr>
<p>I currently graduated from American University with Master's Degree of Statistics. In the next 5 years, I see myself developing into a full stack data scientist. Pursuing a Ph.D degree of <b>Data Science</b> or <b>Computer Science</b> would be one of the good choices. I am really into delicious food, so I am passionate about trying new recipes and dinning out in good restaurants. You are welcome to share me nice recipes and restaurants. 🍕 🍔 🍟 🍗 🍖 🍝 🍛 🍤
