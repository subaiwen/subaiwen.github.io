## Introduction
Machine learning: Learning from data

- Supervised learning: Predict an outcome measurement (quantitative or categorical) based on a set of **_features_**.  
> **_Training set_**: Observe the outcome and feature measurements for a set of objects to build a prediction model, or **_learner_**, which will enable us to predict the outcome for new unseen objects. 

- Unsupervised learning: Observe only the features and have no measurements of the outcome to describe how the data are organized or clustered.
