## Introduction
Machine learning: Learning from data

- Supervised learning: An outcome measurement (quantitative or categorical) to predict based on a set of *features*.  
> *Training set*: observe the outcome and feature measurements for a set of objects to build a prediction model, or *learner*, which will enable us to predict the outcome for new unseen objects. 

- Unsupervised learning: observe only the features and have no measurements of the outcome to describe how the data are organized or clustered.
