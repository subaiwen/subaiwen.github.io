## Overview
- [Matplotlib](#matplotlib): low level, provides lots of freedom
- [Seaborn](#seaborn): high-level interface, great default styles
- [ggplot](#ggplot): based on Râ€™s ggplot2
- [Plotly](#plotly): can create interactive plots
- [Dash](#dash): building analytical web applications

## matplotlib
> [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org) is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Despite being over a decade old, it's still the most widely used library for plotting in the Python community. It was designed to closely resemble MATLAB, a proprietary programming language developed in the 1980s.

## seaborn
> [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## ggplot
> [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com) is a plotting system for Python based on R's ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics.



## dash & plotly
> [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)'s Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs.  
> [dash](https://dash.plot.ly) is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.
